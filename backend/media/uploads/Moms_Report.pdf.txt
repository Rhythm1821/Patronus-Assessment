EST. GLOMERULAR FILTRATION RATE (eGFR) CALCULATED 102 mL/min/1.73 m2
Bio. Ref. Interval. :-
> = 90 : Normal
60 - 89 : Mild Decrease
45 - 59 : Mild to Moderate Decrease
30 - 44 : Moderate to Severe Decrease
15 - 29 : Severe Decrease
Clinical Significance
The normal serum creatinine reference interval does not necessarily reflect a normal GFR for a patient. Because mild and
moderate kidney injury is poorly inferred from serum creatinine alone. Thus, it is recommended for clinical laboratories to routinely
estimate glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), a “gold standard” measurement for assessment of renal function, and report the value
when serum creatinine is measured for patients 18 and older, when appropriate and feasible. It cannot be measured easily in
clinical practice, instead, GFR is estimated from equations using serum creatinine, age, race and sex. This provides easy to
interpret information for the doctor and patient on the degree of renal impairment since it approximately equates to the
percentage of kidney function remaining. Application of CKD-EPI equation together with the other diagnostic tools in renal
medicine will further improve the detection and management of patients with CKD.
